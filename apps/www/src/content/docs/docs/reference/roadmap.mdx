title: 𝦶 Roadmap
description: Upcoming features and development plans for Curiositi
---

Curiositi is actively developed. This roadmap outlines what has been built and what is planned.

## Current Status

Curiositi currently supports the following types of data:

- Text
  - PDF
  - Text-based files like Markdown, HTML, etc.
  - Office Docs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Images
  - JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.

## Planned

### Web Pages

This requires scraping the web page, generating metadata for it, and then generating embeddings for the content and the metadata. Ideally this would use Firecrawl.

### Audio

This requires transcribing the audio, generating metadata for it, and then generating embeddings for the content and the metadata.

### Video

- **User Uploaded Videos** — Transcribe the audio, generate metadata, and generate embeddings for the content and metadata. Extract frames from the video, pass them into a Vision-capable model, and generate embeddings for them (similar to image embedding).
- **YouTube Videos** — Download the videos, transcribe the audio, generate metadata, and generate embeddings. Extract frames and generate embeddings using a Vision-capable model.

### Browser Extension

This would allow users to save any text they come across on the web.

### Mobile App

This would function exactly the same as the web app.
