description: Find files by meaning with Curiositi's semantic search
---

Curiositi's semantic search goes beyond keyword matching. Find files by meaning, context, and intent — even when you don't remember exact filenames or terms.

## What is Semantic Search?

Traditional search looks for exact keyword matches:

```
Search: "quarterly report"
Matches: Files containing the words "quarterly" AND "report"
Misses: "Q1 financial summary", "quarter earnings review"
```

Semantic search understands meaning:

```
Search: "quarterly report"
Matches: "Q1 financial summary", "quarter earnings review", "fiscal report Q1"
Because: AI understands these all relate to periodic financial reports
```

## How It Works

### 1. Vector Embeddings

When files are processed, their content is split into chunks and each chunk is converted into a 1536-dimensional vector embedding that captures semantic meaning:

```
"quarterly sales report"  → [0.023, -0.156, 0.892, ...]
"Q1 revenue summary"      → [0.019, -0.142, 0.887, ...]

Similar meaning = Similar vectors = Close in vector space
```

### 2. Query Embedding

When you search, your query text is also converted to a vector embedding using the same model.

### 3. Similarity Search

PostgreSQL with pgvector performs a cosine similarity search, comparing your query vector against all stored chunk vectors and returning the closest matches.

### 4. Result Aggregation

Matching chunks are grouped by their source file and returned with similarity scores.

## Using Search

### Search via tRPC

Curiositi provides two search procedures:

#### Semantic Search (AI-only)

Use `searchWithAI` for pure semantic search using vector embeddings:

```typescript
const results = trpc.file.searchWithAI.useQuery({
  query: "quarterly sales report",
  limit: 10,           // optional, max 100
  minSimilarity: 0.7,  // optional, 0.0 to 1.0
});
```

#### Hybrid Search (Filename + Semantic)

Use `search` for combined filename and semantic search:

```typescript
const results = trpc.file.search.useQuery({
  query: "report",
  limit: 20,  // optional, max 50
});
```

This combines traditional filename matching with semantic search for broader coverage.

The search is automatically scoped to the user's active workspace.

### Natural Language Queries

Simply describe what you're looking for:

```
"meeting notes about the product launch"
"contract with Acme Corporation"
"presentation about Q4 marketing strategy"
```

### Image Search

Images are searchable by their AI-generated descriptions. When an image is processed, a vision model generates a text description, which is then embedded:

```
Search: "team photo from offsite"
Finds: IMG_2847.jpg (description: "Group of employees at mountain retreat")

Search: "dashboard mockup with blue theme"
Finds: design-v2.png (description: "UI mockup showing analytics dashboard")
```

## Search Tips

### Writing Good Queries

1. **Be specific** — "Q1 marketing campaign budget" rather than "budget"
2. **Use natural language** — Ask as you would a colleague
3. **Include context** — "last month's sales data" rather than "sales"
4. **Try variations** — If one query doesn't find what you need, rephrase it

### Relevance Scoring

Results include a similarity score (0.0 to 1.0):

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.90+ | Very high relevance |
| 0.80-0.89 | High relevance |
| 0.70-0.79 | Good relevance |
| 0.60-0.69 | Moderate relevance |
| < 0.60 | Lower relevance |

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found

1. Check the file has completed processing (status: `completed`)
2. Try different phrasing
3. Lower the `minSimilarity` threshold
4. Verify you're in the correct workspace

### Irrelevant Results

1. Make your query more specific
2. Increase the `minSimilarity` threshold
3. Check similarity scores in results to gauge relevance
