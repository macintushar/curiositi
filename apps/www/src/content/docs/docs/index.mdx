Curiositi is your **digital brain** — an AI-powered application that helps you store, organize, and effortlessly find any file using semantic search.

## What is Curiositi?

Curiositi transforms how you manage digital content. Instead of remembering exact filenames or folder locations, simply describe what you're looking for in natural language. The AI understands meaning and context to surface the right files instantly.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Smart Storage" icon="document">
		Upload PDFs, images, text files, and more. Files are stored in
		S3-compatible storage and processed automatically.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Semantic Search" icon="magnifier">
		Find files by meaning, not just keywords. Ask "quarterly sales report" and
		find relevant documents even if they don't contain those exact words.
	</Card>
	<Card title="AI Processing" icon="setting">
		Every file is automatically processed to extract content, chunk it, and
		create searchable vector embeddings.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Fast and Scalable" icon="rocket">
		Built on PostgreSQL with pgvector, Upstash QStash for async processing,
		and Bun for performance.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Spaces" icon="seti:folder">
		Organize files in hierarchical spaces. Create nested structures that match
		how you think.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Workspaces" icon="list-format">
		Collaborate with teams using multi-tenant workspace support. All content
		is scoped to your workspace.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/macintushar/curiositi.git
cd curiositi

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start development servers
bun run dev
```

Visit the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/getting-started) guide for detailed setup instructions.

## How It Works

1. **Upload** — Drag and drop any supported file into Curiositi
2. **Process** — The worker extracts content and generates embeddings in the background
3. **Organize** — Add files to spaces, create nested hierarchies
4. **Search** — Find anything using natural language queries

## Supported File Types

| Category | Formats |
|----------|---------|
| **Documents** | PDF |
| **Text** | Plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md), CSV |
| **Data** | JSON, XML |
| **Web** | HTML |
| **Images** | JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF (with AI-generated descriptions) |

Maximum file size: **50 MB**

## Architecture Overview

Curiositi is built as a monorepo with Turborepo and Bun:

- **Platform** — React 19 web app with TanStack Start, tRPC v11, and Tailwind CSS v4
- **Worker** — Hono server on Bun for AI-powered file processing
- **Database** — PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and pgvector for embeddings
- **Storage** — S3-compatible object storage for files
- **Queue** — Upstash QStash for background job processing
