<TextPageLayout title="Privacy Policy" description="How Curiositi collects, uses, and protects your data">

At Curiositi, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our service.

## Open-Source & Self-Hosting

Curiositi is [open-source software](https://github.com/macintushar/curiositi) licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0). This privacy policy applies to the hosted service at curiositi.xyz and any data you store on our servers.

If you choose to self-host Curiositi, you are responsible for your own data privacy and security. This privacy policy does not apply to self-hosted instances, as we do not have access to or control over data stored on your own infrastructure.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information

When you create an account on our hosted service, we collect your name, email address, and password. If you subscribe to a paid plan, we collect billing information through our payment processor.

### Content You Upload

We store the files, links, notes, and other content you upload to Curiositi. This includes documents, images, videos, and any other materials you choose to organize in your spaces.

### Usage Data

We collect information about how you interact with our service, including features you use, search queries, and device information (browser type, operating system, IP address).

## How We Use Your Information

- **Provide the Service:** To operate Curiositi and enable you to organize, search, and access your content.
- **AI Features:** To power our AI search and assistant features that help you find and connect your ideas.
- **Improvements:** To analyze usage patterns and improve our product.
- **Communications:** To send you service updates, security alerts, and support messages.

## Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption. We use cloud infrastructure providers with robust security practices. All data in transit is encrypted using TLS, and data at rest is encrypted using modern encryption standards.

We implement access controls, regular security audits, and monitoring to protect against unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Services

We use trusted third-party services for:

- Cloud storage and hosting
- Payment processing
- Analytics
- AI and machine learning services

These providers are contractually bound to use your data only for the purposes of providing services to us and are prohibited from using it for their own purposes.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights including:

- Accessing your personal data
- Correcting inaccurate data
- Deleting your data
- Exporting your data
- Objecting to certain processing
- Withdrawing consent

To exercise these rights, contact us at privacy@curiositi.xyz.

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your personal information within 30 days, except where we need to retain it for legal obligations, dispute resolution, or enforcement of our agreements.

## Children's Privacy

Curiositi is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by email or through the service. Continued use of Curiositi after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
