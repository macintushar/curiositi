This is Curiositi's Monorepo. It uses Turborepo and Bun. All packages and apps use Bun.

We use ESLint for Linting & Prettier for Formatting.

We use GitHub for Version Control and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

This is a pure TypeScript project. We use Bun for running the code.

Commands:

- `bun run dev` - Runs all apps in Dev mode
- `bun run build` - Builds all apps (just web currently since server runs with Bun without transpilation)
