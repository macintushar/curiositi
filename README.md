# Curiositi üß†

Curiositi is an AI-powered assistant that delivers precise, context-aware answers by combining user documents with live web data. It implements a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to help you find and synthesize information across your files, and the internet.

## üîç What Curiositi Does

1. **Document Ingestion**

   - Upload files via the API.
   - Automatically extract, split, and embed your documents into a vector store for fast similarity search.

2. **Query Handling**

   - Clients send natural-language questions to `/api/v1/query`.
   - The agent selects a strategy:
     - **Direct**: answer immediately using the LLM's knowledge.
     - **Retrieve**: generate sub-queries against uploaded docs and web (via SearXNG).

3. **Context Retrieval**

   - **Document Search**: similarity search in ChromaDB returns top-scoring chunks.
   - **Web Search**: SearXNG tool fetches external results.

4. **Answer Synthesis**
   - Retrieved results are combined and fed back into the LLM.
   - The final answer is synthesized with citations and returned alongside metadata.
