🚀 You're Invited to Curiositi Beta - The Open-Source AI Knowledge Workspace

Hey there! 👋

I'm excited to invite you to try Curiositi - a private, self-hostable AI knowledge workspace that's now in beta. Think of it as your personal AI assistant that actually knows your documents and can search the web to give you comprehensive, well-reasoned answers.
What makes Curiositi special?

✨ Your Data, Your Control - Upload PDFs, Office docs, and text files, organize them into spaces, and chat with an AI that uses YOUR knowledge as its foundation

🧠 Smart RAG + Web Search - Our agent doesn't just search your docs - it plans queries, searches your knowledge AND the web in parallel, then synthesizes answers with reasoning

🔒 Privacy-First - Self-hostable with secure authentication, so your sensitive documents never leave your infrastructure

⚡ Modern Stack - Built with Bun, Next.js 15, and cutting-edge tech for blazing fast performance

Perfect for:
Teams drowning in scattered documentation
Researchers who need AI that understands their work
Anyone who wants powerful AI without vendor lock-in
Developers who appreciate clean, extensible architecture
