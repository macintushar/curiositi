# Security Policy

Curiositi is an open source (OSS) project. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will do our best to respond quickly.

## Supported versions

We only support the latest code on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

You can report security issues publicly or privately.

If you believe the issue is actively exploitable, high impact, or requires sharing exploit details, please use a private channel.

Public:
- Open a GitHub issue.

Private:
- GitHub Security Advisories (use the repository's "Report a vulnerability" flow).
- Email: hi@macintushar.xyz

Include (when possible):
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected components/paths and any relevant logs

Please avoid sending real user data and redact secrets (API keys, tokens, cookies).

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as practical (typically within 72 hours).
- We will triage and share an initial assessment as soon as practical (typically within 7 days).
- If a fix is needed, we will work with you on remediation and coordinated disclosure timing.

## Bounty program

Curiositi does not run a bug bounty program.

## Safe harbor

We welcome good-faith security research. Please avoid:
- Privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption
- Social engineering
- Automated scanning that harms availability
